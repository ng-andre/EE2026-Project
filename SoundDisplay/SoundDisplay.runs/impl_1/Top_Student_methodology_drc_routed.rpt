2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.293 ns between DM0/Oled_Display/FSM_onehot_state_reg[13]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and DM0/oled_data_reg[15]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
